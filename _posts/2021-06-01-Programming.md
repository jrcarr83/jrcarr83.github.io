title: R vs Other Languages
---

 	Prior to enrolling in the Masters in Statistics program at NC State, a few years back I also attended NC State remotely to attain my Computer Science certificate. Within that program I learned everything from assembly, to C#, to Java. Java was easily my favorite language up to that point, and it translated easily into learning Python on my own. Python has now taken over as my preferred language because it's easily accessable and widely used; but also, like R, it has a wide variety of packages that can be installed that removes much of the heavy lifting involved in writing programs. However, in my current role, I mostly use SAS.
  
  Prior to this class I did have a good amount of experience in R, but no formal training. I picked up R markdown a year or two ago, and have enjoyed using it since. One issue I have run into coding in R without training is that I generally write procedural instead of object-based code. Already, I am starting to see how I can write a more object-based style in R with functions, so I think that is something I will begin changing. Other than coding style, I have also struggled to understand factors, and work with them inside of data frames. I remember a previous R project in a Bayesian class where I spent more time than I would care to admit figuring out how to manipuate the data and work with factors. 
  
  Once this class is complete, I will have four solid methods of working with data: SQL, SAS data steps, pandas, and dplyr. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but I think being comfortable in all of those environments will be a huge advantage for me.
