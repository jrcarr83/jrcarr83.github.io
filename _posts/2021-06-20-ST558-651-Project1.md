Last week, we were asked to begin project 1 in the NC State Data Science summer course. The goal was to create a vignette, or read me document, on a grouping of functions that utilize API calls to NHL data. Before I get started discussing the project, a few important links:

*  [Main Github Repo](https://github.com/jrcarr83/jrcarr83.github.io)
*  [Project 1 Repo](https://github.com/jrcarr83/st558-651-project-1)
*  [Proect 1 Vignette](https://jrcarr83.github.io/st558-651-project-1/)

Initially, writing the API calls seemed to be the easiest part, but after looking further into it there were two calls that were a bit trickier than the others. The franchise details, for instance, wanted to return an HTML list into the columns and it is something I never got around to updating because I did not use that particular dataset in my vignette. Also, the team stats returned lists within lists for the stat groupings. That issue I did address because that was a dataset I was keen on working with. Other than those issues, I found querying the API to be relatively straight forward. 

Another issue of note when working with the data was that some calls required one ID, while others required a different ID. That is just one of those can only be addressed through good metadata, domain knowledge, or learning the data through trial and error. I mostly relied on trial and error.

My favorite data to work with was the team statistics, franchise records, and goalie/skater records. I would not say I found anything outright surprising, but
