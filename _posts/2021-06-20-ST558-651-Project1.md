Last week, we were asked to begin project 1 in the NC State Data Science summer course. The goal was to create a vignette, or read me document, on a grouping of functions that utilize API calls to NHL data. Before I get started discussing the project, a few important links:

*  [Main Github Repo](https://github.com/jrcarr83/jrcarr83.github.io)
*  [Project 1 Repo](https://github.com/jrcarr83/st558-651-project-1)
*  [Proect 1 Vignette](https://jrcarr83.github.io/st558-651-project-1/)

Initially, writing the API calls seemed to be the easiest part, but after looking further into it there were two calls that were a bit trickier than the others. The franchise details, for instance, wanted to return an HTML list into the columns and it is something I never got around to updating because I did not use that particular dataset in my vignette. Also, the team stats returned lists within lists for the stat groupings. That issue I did address because that was a dataset I was keen on working with. Other than those issues, I found querying the API to be relatively straight forward. 

Another issue of note when working with the data was that some calls required one ID, while others required a different ID. That is just one of those can only be addressed through good metadata, domain knowledge, or learning the data through trial and error. I mostly relied on trial and error.

My favorite data to work with was the team statistics, franchise records, and goalie/skater records. I would not say I found anything outright surprising, but there were a few interesting views. In the bar graph below, comparing regular season win % vs the post season win % for each franchise across their history seems to show that most franchises perform relatively similarly in both formats. However, I was surprised to see that no teams really over-perform.

Another view that provided some unique insight was the most amount of goals conceded by all goalies. It is surprisingly overlapped for both goalies that tend to win and goalies that tend to lose, and I am not sure I expected that. When you look at the histogram with the overlayed kernels, however, you can see that the goalies that tend to win are a bit more centered in the 4-5 goals range and skewed right, whereas the goalies that tend to lose more have a bit more spread. I do think it goes to show that everyone has a bad night, and those bad nights can be just as catastrophic for winning goalies as losing goalies.

The project itself ended up being more intesive than I expected. While nothing was overtly complex, little complications here and there combined to make running out of time a real issue. I started the project early, I thought, and had the functions written quickly. However, as I dove into the data more, the devil clearly in the details and, speaking of details, the details function was my least favorite.
