## Introduction
For project 2, I worked with fellow student David Arthur on analyzing and creating models for a bike sharing service data set ([found here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)). We were asked to summarize the data, split it into test and training sets, and create model outputs for each of the seven days of the week. Both David and I were to create a linear model, he also created a random forest tree, and I created a boosting tree. We were then to automate the comparison of those models and output the best model. A few important links:

## Daily Outputs
As I mentioned above, we summaries and model outputs for each day of the week. You can find the each day's output in the links below:

*  [Sunday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Sunday.md)
*  [Monday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Monday.md)
*  [Tuesday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Tuesday.md)
*  [Wednesday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Wednesday.md)
*  [Thursday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Thursday.md)
*  [Friday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Friday.md)
*  [Saturday](https://github.com/davidearthur/ST558Project2/blob/main/Saturday.md)

The R markdown file that contains the logic for each analysis can be found in the file named *ST558Project2.Rmd*, and the file that is able to knit that markdown file for each day of the week can be found in an R file named *ST558RenderProject2.R*.

## Discussion
As with most projects, one of the things I find the most difficult is understanding the project holistically to understand how each piece interacts with the other. Often, I try to look at individual pieces to work on, and then I try to stitch them together for the final product. In this case, that proved to be an issue because much of my initial analysis was focused around registered vs. casual riders, and how that trends over each day of the week. While that analysis certainly did help me understand the data better, it was not particuarly useful for the final product because we were asked to look at each day individually, so graphs trended across the week were not possible. 

Going back, if I were to change my approach, I would attempt to pick out each *action item* related to me (parts that I am supposed to analyze) and write them all day in some sort of bullets or list. Then, I could use the much shorter list to come up with a plan so that I have a better idea of how to proceed instead of just diving in. 

Another takeaway I noticed is that I am not particularly happy with my linear model selection process. I want to stop relying so much on automated stepwise and best subsets processes and improve at building my own models. In this case, I did not do anything to look for non-linearity or interactions, and I am sure there were some. The boosting model was quite succesful, and if I am just looking for the best prediction results, using a method like that going forward makes sense. But in my job and in many cases, interpretability is important, and the ability to create more accurate linear models is something I want to focus on.

Lastly, I was a bit surprised that there was so much variability in model performance for each of the days of the week. In fact, in the Tuesday analysis, a linear model beat out the boosting and random forest trees. Some weekdays were quite close in for each model, and others the boosting tree blew the others out of the water. We did not have a ton of data, so that could be the cause of that variability, but I was still surprised because I expected the boosting model to outperform the others every time.
